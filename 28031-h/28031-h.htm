<p><span class="dcap">"You're</span> a fascinating
person," the girl said. "I've
never met anyone like you
before. Tell me your story
again."</p>

<p>The man was short and
stocky, with Asiatic features
and a long, stringy mustache.
"The whole story?" he asked.
"It would take a lifetime to
tell you." He stared out the
window at the yellow sun and
the red sun. He still hadn't
gotten used to seeing two
suns. But that was minor, really,
when there were so many
other things he had to get
used to.</p>

<p>A robot waiter, with long
thin metal tubes for arms and
legs, glided over. When he'd
first seen one of those, he'd
thought it was a demon. He'd
tried to smash it. They'd had
trouble with him at first.</p>

<p>"They had trouble with me
at first," he said.</p>

<p>"I can imagine," said the
girl. "How did they explain it
to you?"</p>

<p>"It was hard. They had to
give me the whole history of
medicine. It was years before
I got over the notion that I
was up in the Everlasting
Blue Sky, or under the earth,
or something." He grinned at
the girl. She was the first person
he'd met since they got
him a job and gave him a home
in a world uncountable light
years from the one he'd been
born on.</p>

<p>"When did you begin to understand?"</p>

<p>"They simply taught all of
history to me. Including the
part about myself. Then I began
to get the picture. Funny.
I wound up teaching them a
lot of history."</p>

<p>"I bet you know a lot."</p>

<p>"I do," the man with the
Asiatic features said modestly.
"Anyway, they finally got
across to me that in the 22nd
century&mdash;they had explained
the calendar to me, too; I
used a different one in my
day&mdash;they had learned how to
grow new limbs on people
who had lost arms and legs."</p>

<p>"That was the first real
step," said the girl.</p>

<p>"It was a long time till they
got to the second step," he
said. "They learned how to
stimulate life and new growth
in people who had already
died."</p>

<p>"The next part is the thing
I don't understand," the girl
said.</p>

<p>"Well," said the man, "as I
get it, they found that any
piece of matter that has been
part of an organism, retains a
physical 'memory' of the entire
structure of the organism
of which it was part. And that
they could reconstruct that
structure from a part of a person,
if that was all there was
left of him. From there it was
just a matter of pushing the
process back through time.
They had to teach me a whole
new language to explain that
one."</p>

<p>"Isn't it wonderful that intergalactic
travel gives us
room to expand?" said the
girl. "I mean now that every
human being that ever lived
has been brought back to life
and will live forever?"</p>

<p>"Same problem I had, me
and my people," said the man.
"We were cramped for space.
This age has solved it a lot
better than I did. But they had
to give me a whole psychological
overhauling before I understood
that."</p>

<p>"Tell me about your past
life," said the girl, staring
dreamily at him.</p>

<p>"Well, six thousand years
ago, I was born in the Gobi
Desert, on Earth," said Genghis
Khan, sipping his drink.</p>
